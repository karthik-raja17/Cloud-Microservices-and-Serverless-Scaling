# Cloud Microservices and Serverless Scaling on Azure This repository documents the implementation and performance analysis of various cloud architectures on **Microsoft Azure**, as completed for the EURECOM 'Clouds Course' Lab 2. The project demonstrates proficiency in building scalable microservices, deploying them on different Azure compute models, and evaluating their resilience and performance under load. --- ## üöÄ Key Project Components ### 1. Numerical Integration Microservice A core microservice was developed to perform **numerical integration** of the function $abs(\sin(x))$ over a given interval. This computationally intensive task was used as a workload for subsequent load testing and scaling experiments. The service was implemented to compute the integral across a range of subintervals ($N=10$ up to $N=1M$) to ensure a demanding load. ### 2. Microservice Deployment and Scaling Analysis The integration service was deployed and load-tested across four different Azure compute scenarios using the **Locust** load testing tool (`locust -f locustfile.py --headless -u 50 -r 5 -t 3m`). | Deployment Scenario | Goal & Key Finding | | :--- | :--- | | **Locally Deployed Service** | Established a baseline performance metric for the application without cloud overhead. | | **VM Scale Set with 2 VMs** | Tested **resilience and recovery** by shutting down a VM mid-test, measuring the impact on successful requests/second. | | **Autoscale WebApp** | Evaluated **horizontal scaling** capability, configured to scale from **1 up to 3 instances**, measuring the web service's ability to handle increasing user concurrency. | | **Autoscale Function (Serverless)** | Tested the cost-efficient, event-driven scaling of **Azure Functions** under high load. | ### 3. Serverless MapReduce with Durable Functions A powerful serverless architecture was implemented for a **Word Counter (MapReduce)** application using **Azure Durable Functions**. * **Orchestrator Function:** Manages the entire workflow, orchestrating parallel execution. * **Activity Functions:** Performed the core logic: * **Data Ingestion (`GetInputDataFn`):** Used the Python client library and connection strings to securely pull input text files from **Azure Blob Storage**. * **Mapper/Reducer:** Implemented the Map and Reduce steps to perform the word counting logic in a distributed, parallel fashion, leveraging the asynchronous and fault-tolerant nature of Durable Functions. This deployment demonstrated a fully serverless, highly-parallel data processing pipeline capable of handling large datasets retrieved directly from Azure storage. --- ## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills | Category | Skills Demonstrated | | :--- | :--- | | **Azure Services** | Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), Azure WebApp, Azure Functions, Azure Durable Functions, Azure Blob Storage. | | **Cloud Development** | Serverless Architecture, Deployment via Azure CLI/Portal, MapReduce implementation. | | **Performance Testing** | **Locust** (Load generation, headless mode, performance reporting), analyzing throughput, and identifying bottlenecks. | | **Programming** | Python (for microservice logic, load testing, and Azure client libraries). |
